# Basic Requirements

This topic covers the basic resources needed to run a Minecraft Server for 4 on AWS.

## Requirements

- AWS Account with **Administrator Access**
- Management Console Access
- Local Terminal with ssh
- A brain (Optional)

## Note

Do **NOT** use a **ROOT** AWS Account to create the resources for this project. This is a bad practice and can lead to security issues. Instead, create a new IAM User with Administrator Access and use that account to create the resources.
